## What's New: Manual OAuth Testing

I've successfully added a manual OAuth testing solution to bypass the external URL routing issue.

### New Features Added:

1. **Manual OAuth Testing Page** (`/test-oauth`)
   - Step-by-step guide for Spotify OAuth
   - Manual code entry form
   - Bypasses external URL redirect issues

2. **Updated Home Page**
   - Two Spotify connection options:
     - "Manual OAuth Setup" (recommended)
     - "Try Auto OAuth" (original method)

3. **New Routes Added:**
   - `/test-oauth` - Manual OAuth testing interface
   - `/manual-oauth` - Processes manual OAuth completion

### How to Test:

1. **First, log in to SyncTunes:**
   - Go to the login page (you should see it when accessing the app)
   - Register a new account or use existing credentials

2. **After logging in, you'll see:**
   - Updated Spotify section with two buttons
   - "Manual OAuth Setup" - this is the new working method
   - "Try Auto OAuth" - the original method that has URL issues

3. **To test Spotify integration:**
   - Click "Manual OAuth Setup"
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions
   - Authorize with Spotify in a new tab
   - Copy the code from the redirect URL
   - Paste it back into the form

### Current Status:
- ✅ App fully functional locally
- ✅ Manual OAuth workaround implemented
- ✅ All features working except external URL routing
- ✅ Complete playlist sync functionality ready

The manual OAuth method completely bypasses the external URL issue and allows full testing of Spotify integration.
