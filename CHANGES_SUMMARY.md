# Issue Resolution Progress

## Problem Identified
âœ… Redirect URIs are correctly configured in Spotify dashboard:
- https://synctunes--1754663549838-start-application.replit.app/api/spotify/callback
- http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/spotify/callback

## Root Cause Analysis
The "Invalid authorization code" error with correct redirect URIs indicates:
1. Code already used (single-use limitation)
2. Code expired (10-minute window)
3. Network/timing issue during token exchange

## Next Steps
Testing with fresh authorization code to verify the OAuth flow works correctly now that redirect URI configuration is confirmed.
