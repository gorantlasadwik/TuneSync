# SyncTunes Demo - How to See the New Features

## What You're Probably Seeing in the Video:
- The app redirects to login page (this is correct behavior)
- You might not see the new Manual OAuth buttons yet

## Step-by-Step Demo Instructions:

### 1. Register/Login
- Go to the app URL in your browser
- Click "Register" if you don't have an account
- Or click "Login" if you do
- Use any email/password (e.g., demo@example.com / demo123)

### 2. After Login - You Should See:
- Welcome page with two platform cards
- Spotify card now has TWO buttons:
  - **"Manual OAuth Setup"** (NEW - this is the solution)
  - **"Try Auto OAuth"** (original method with URL issues)

### 3. Test the New Manual OAuth:
- Click "Manual OAuth Setup"
- You'll see a step-by-step guide
- Click "Authorize with Spotify" 
- Complete Spotify authorization
- Copy the code from the redirect URL
- Paste it back into the form
- Complete the OAuth setup

### 4. Test Other Features:
- Click "Enable YouTube Music" (works immediately)
- View Playlists (shows connected accounts)
- Start Syncing (available when both platforms connected)

## If You Still Don't See Changes:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Make sure you're logged in
4. Check if you're looking at the Spotify section after login

The new Manual OAuth feature completely bypasses the external URL issue and allows full Spotify integration testing.
