# IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Localhost Testing

Since you're having trouble with the Spotify redirect URI, let me create a localhost version that works immediately.

## What I'll Set Up:
1. **Localhost version** running on http://localhost:5000
2. **Local redirect URI**: http://localhost:5000/api/spotify/callback  
3. **Updated Spotify config** for local testing
4. **Simple setup instructions**

## Benefits:
- Works immediately without changing Spotify dashboard
- Perfect for testing all features
- Can demo complete sync functionality
- No domain/URL issues

## Steps:
1. I'll create localhost configuration
2. You run the app locally
3. Use local OAuth flow
4. Test complete playlist syncing

Would you like me to set up the localhost solution right now? This will get you testing immediately while we figure out the deployment domain later.
