# Localhost Setup - Immediate Testing

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Update Your Spotify App
Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and add this redirect URI:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/spotify/callback
```

### 2. Run Locally
```bash
python run_local.py
```

### 3. Test
1. Go to: http://localhost:5000
2. Login with: demo@example.com / demo123
3. Click "Manual OAuth Setup"
4. Complete Spotify authorization
5. Test playlist syncing

## Why This Works:
- Uses localhost instead of Replit domain
- No external URL routing issues
- Standard OAuth flow
- Complete feature testing

## After Testing:
Once you confirm it works locally, we can:
1. Fix the deployment domain
2. Update production redirect URI
3. Deploy the working solution

This gets you testing immediately while we solve the deployment issue separately.
