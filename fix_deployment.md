# SyncTunes Deployment Fix

## Current Issue
- Flask app runs perfectly on localhost:5000
- External HTTPS URL returns 404 - routing issue with Replit proxy
- Spotify OAuth redirect URI already configured in your developer account

## Solution: Use Replit Deployment
The current setup runs in development mode. For external access to work properly, you need to deploy it:

1. Click the **"Deploy"** button in Replit (top-right)
2. Choose "Autoscale" deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Use the deployment URL that will be provided

## Current Configuration
- App: ✅ Working locally
- Port mapping: ✅ Configured (5000 → 80)
- OAuth credentials: ✅ Set up
- Redirect URI: Already configured for this domain

## Expected Result
After deployment, the URL `https://synctunes--1754663549838-start-application.replit.app/api/spotify/callback` should work properly and the Spotify OAuth will function correctly.

The application code is complete and ready for deployment.
